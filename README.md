## About
The repository contains a custom made `Internet Relay Chat server (IRC)` to which connection can be established via the `IRSSI` client. Programming is done in collaboration with:  
- Timo Saari (https://github.com/LandSurroundedByWater)  
- Matti Rinkinen (https://github.com/MRinkinen)

Worksplit (partly overlapping):  

Matti: Client-Server Communication MVP · Private messages · Commands: Join · Signals
  
Timo: Overall architecture · Commands: Join, Kick, Topic, Invite, Nick · Private messages · Signals · Testing, bugfixing
  
Marius: Channels & modes · Commands: Join, Kick, Topic, Invite · Testing, bugfixing

## Program
The server utelises C++ socket programming in order to create a TCP socket which operates over IP4. The server binds to the socket and furhter listens to incoming connection requests of clients. 
The following user commands are handled from the server:
 - JOIN
 - NICK
 - INVITE
 - MSG
 - KICK
 - TOPIC
 - MODE
   - +t (only channel operators can set channel topic)
   - +i (join a channel only possible with an invitation)
   - +k (sets password for the channel)
   - +l (sets user limit for the channel)
   - +o (assigns operator role to a channel member)

## Requirements
- `c++` compiler
- `macOS` or `linux based OS` with `irrsi` chat client

## Instructions

### 1. Compiling the program

To compile the files run the following command in the repository folder in the terminal:

```
$ make 
```

### 2. Launch the server

The server can be launched by passing a `port_number` and `password` to the executable, e.g.
```
$ ./ircserv 9090 1234
```
For connecting a client, open another terminal window and type in the following:
```
$ irssi
```
Establish a connection to the server within irssi with the following command (port number used from example above):
```
$ /connect localhost 9090
```

### 3. Navigation within the IRC
`Join` a channel:
```
/join <channel_name>
```
Change `nickname`:
```
/nick <nickname>
```
`Invite` user to join channel:
```
/invite <nickname_of_invitee>
```
Send `private message` (recipient can change window to private message with cntrl + p):
```
/msg <nickname_of_recipient> <message>
```
Set `mode` (if channel operator):
```
/mode +t
/mode +i
/mode +k <channel_password>
/mode +l <channel_user_limit>
/mode +o <channel_member>
```
Set `topic` of a channel:
```
/topic <channel_topic>
```

`Kick` users from channels (if channel operator):
```
/kick <channel_member>
```
